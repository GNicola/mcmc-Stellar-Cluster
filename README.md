# mcmc-Stellar-Cluster
This is the program I have written for my bachelor's thesis. It is based on the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) with Metropolis Hasting algorithm. The code is used to compute the most important parameters which describe a stellar cluster, such as age, metallicity, distance modulus and reddening.
I have not uploaded the input data namely the table with the isochrones.
